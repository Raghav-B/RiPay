***A digital solution for crowd-lending catered to the youth and small enterprises of Singapore***

### Our Purpose:

Everyone loves small businesses, from the local bubble tea shop around the corner, to the bookshop at the near by shopping complex. These businesses are the ones that we remember, and are where memories are made. However, these same businesses are the most at risk of closure during periods of economic hardship - a situation we are currently in due to the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic.

Our aim is to help users choose to provide spare capital to these businesses to help keep them alive. This is our vision of the "vote with your wallet" idea. We want to help make this process easy - we want to be the catalyst that keep these cherished businesses alive.

### What do we do?

We provide a platform to help connect consumers to businesses in the form of unsecured micro loans. We want to connect people with their local businesses and give them the option to support these businesses especially during tough times like we are experiencing right now (COVID-19).

Enterprises can offer a rewards for these contributions through discounts or other means - we encourage them to be creative. However, this is entirely option. But, it is recommended if you businesses want to bolster their claims for contributions.

### How Do We Work?

#### For Lenders

To achieve our goal to connect users and businesses, we have developed the RiPay app.

#### For Enterprises

Businesses looking for capital can create a profile on the app.

They can then create a goal amount, as well as provide information justifying the loans and potential rewards for lenders.

### Looking Forward

We are very excited about the strides we have made with our app, but given the limited time we made practical decisions to limit the scope of our product. In the future, we hope to introduce several more features including:

- A Leaderboard of contributions and returns
- Razer Gold integration
- Offering loyalty rewards
- A referral system to increase adoption

### Who are we?
